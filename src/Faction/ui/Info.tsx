                Faction favor increases the rate at which you earn reputation for this faction by 1% per favor. Faction
                favor is gained whenever you install an Augmentation. The amount of favor you gain depends on the total
                amount of reputation you earned with this faction. Across all resets.

        Perform work/carry out assignments for your faction to help further its cause! By doing so you will earn
        reputation for your faction. You will also gain reputation passively over time, although at a very slow rate.
        Earning reputation will allow you to purchase Augmentations through this faction, which are powerful upgrades
        that enhance your abilities.
